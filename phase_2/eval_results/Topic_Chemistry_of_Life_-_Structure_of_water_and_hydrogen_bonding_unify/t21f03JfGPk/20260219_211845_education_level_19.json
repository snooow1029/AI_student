The pacing is slow, and the visual elements are overly simplistic and lack professional polish. Key opportunities to deepen understanding by connecting to prior chemistry knowledge (e.g., electronegativity, delta notation for partial charges) are missed, and the reliance on colloquial terms like 'sticky' is not sufficiently scaffolded to precise scientific vocabulary."

    "description": "The student is a working professional whose career trajectory has largely been in a field unrelated to biology, such as finance or marketing, yet they have developed a keen interest in the natural sciences, particularly at the molecular level. They are eager to delve into the Chemistry of Life course to satisfy a burgeoning curiosity about how fundamental chemical principles underpin biological processes, aiming to enhance their understanding of topics like water's unique properties and the significance of hydrogen bonding in biological systems. Despite lacking formal education in biology, the student has a foundational knowledge of general chemistry acquired through self-study and online courses, equipping them with a basic understanding of atomic structures, chemical bonds, and molecular interactions. By mastering the structure of water and hydrogen bonding, the student hopes to gain insights that could inform their personal interest in environmental science and potentially open new avenues for interdisciplinary applications in their current profession.",
