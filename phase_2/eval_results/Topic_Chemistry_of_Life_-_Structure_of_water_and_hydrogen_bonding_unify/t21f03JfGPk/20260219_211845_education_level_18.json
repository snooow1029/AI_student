      "category": "Accuracy",

      "justification": "The core scientific concepts (polarity, hydrogen bonding, cohesion, adhesion) are presented correctly. However, the introductory claim about a '2025-2026' curriculum update is factually incorrect and immediately damages the video's credibility for a detail-oriented professional. The science is functional, but this error prevents a higher score."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The video follows a standard and logical progression: structure -> polarity -> hydrogen bonds -> emergent properties. However, the initial 30-second overview of the entire unit is an unnecessary cognitive load that delays the start of the actual lesson. A more direct approach would be more effective."

      "category": "Adaptability",
      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The content is poorly adapted for the specified persona. A pharmaceutical professional already understands basic bonding. The video misses opportunities to add depth by discussing electronegativity, dipole moments, or explicitly framing hydrogen bonds as a type of dipole-dipole interaction. The use of the magnet analogy and terms like 'sticky' feels condescending to an educated audience."

      "category": "Engagement",
      "score": 3,
      "justification": "The instructor's delivery is clear and paced well. However, the visuals are static and low-fidelity (simple slides, a webcam overlay, and somewhat messy on-screen drawings). There are no animations or dynamic visuals to illustrate the molecular interactions, which would be highly beneficial for a topic like this. It's functional but not compelling."
