The magnet analogy is an oversimplification they have likely moved beyond. The content fails to connect water's properties to the student's stated interests in biotechnology (e.g., water as a universal solvent in lab buffers) or environmental science (e.g., role in climate moderation, acid rain)."

That's what we're unpacking today.'",

Oxygen is highly electronegative, meaning it has a very strong pull on shared electrons, drawing them away from the less electronegative hydrogen atoms. This creates a permanent partial negative charge on the oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens.'",

A dotted line should dynamically form between them, pulse briefly to indicate the electrostatic attraction, and then break as the molecules move on. The narration should emphasize that these are weak, transient bonds, constantly forming and breaking in liquid water.",
