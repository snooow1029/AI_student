The pacing is appropriate for someone with a basic understanding of calculus.

The variety of problems covers essential techniques for limits and continuity. However, the critical error in Problem 10 is a major detractor. It would lead to confusion and frustration, as I would question the validity of the problem itself rather than focusing on the solution method. This significantly reduces engagement and trust in the material, especially when my goal is to build confidence and precision for exams."

  "student_feedback": "The video covers a good range of limit problems, and I appreciate the step-by-step approach. Problems 1 through 8 were excellent for reinforcing different techniques, including the Squeeze Theorem, which is a bit more complex but well-explained. Problem 9 on the Intermediate Value Theorem was also clear. However, I noticed a significant issue with Problem 10. The piecewise function is defined with overlapping domains (x <= 2 and x >= 2), which means it's not a valid function definition. While the method for solving for 'c' might be demonstrated correctly for the *given* problem, the problem itself is flawed. This is very frustrating when I'm trying to thoroughly understand concepts for my exams, as it introduces doubt about the accuracy of the problems presented. I need to be confident that the problems I'm practicing are correctly formulated.",
