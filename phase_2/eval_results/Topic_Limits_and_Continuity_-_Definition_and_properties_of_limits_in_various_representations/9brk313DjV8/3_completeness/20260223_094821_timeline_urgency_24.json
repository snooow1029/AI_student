The pace of allowing me to pause and work through problems is excellent for my learning style. However, the critical logical error in problem 6, where the visual explanation for rearranging terms in the trigonometric limit was mathematically unsound, is a major concern. Even though the final answer was correct, the method shown was flawed, which is incredibly frustrating for someone trying to master these concepts for advanced calculus. I need to understand *why* a step is valid, not just that it leads to the right answer. This kind of inaccuracy makes me question the reliability of the entire video, which is a huge setback for my urgent need to build a strong foundation. I can't afford to learn incorrect methods, even if they're self-corrected later or lead to the right answer by chance. The minor typos in other problems were less impactful as they were self-corrected, but the logical flaw is a deal-breaker for deep understanding.",
