The logical justification for the Squeeze Theorem example was also slightly incomplete, a common simplification at this level but technically a gap."

However, a key omission is a dedicated explanation or conceptual definition of what a limit fundamentally is, despite the title explicitly mentioning 'Definition... of limits'. This led to a -1.0 deduction from both scores for missing a core concept. Regarding specific errors, a minor visual notation error was noted at 03:26, deducting 0.2 from accuracy. For logic, the presentation of trigonometric limit steps at 08:33 was confusing, leading to a -0.2 deduction for information overload. A more significant logical gap occurred at 13:00 during the Squeeze Theorem explanation, where the multiplication of an inequality by 'x' did not account for negative values of 'x', making the justification incomplete and less rigorous, resulting in a -0.5 deduction for a logic leap. Overall, while the examples are well-executed, the lack of a foundational definition and some presentation/rigor issues slightly detract from the instructional quality."

The initial problems were straightforward, allowing me to follow the direct substitution and factoring methods. However, when the video reached the Squeeze Theorem, a critical error in applying the inequality completely derailed my engagement. Multiplying an inequality by 'x' without considering if 'x' is positive or negative is a fundamental mistake that would lead to incorrect conclusions. For a principles-first learner like myself, this isn't a minor oversight; it's a conceptual flaw that undermines the entire explanation and makes me question the validity of the teaching. My goal is to build a robust mathematical framework, and encountering such a basic logical misstep makes the content unhelpful and frustrating. I cannot trust the explanations if core principles are misapplied. This significantly hinders my ability to learn and engage with the material.",
