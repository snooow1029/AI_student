By testing values slightly less than 7 (e.g., 6.9) and slightly more than 7 (e.g., 7.1), it shows the left-hand limit is -1 and the right-hand limit is 1. Since they are not equal, the overall limit does not exist."

Then, it provides a formal solution by rewriting tan(3x) as sin(3x)/cos(3x), rearranging terms to isolate the special limit form sin(ax)/ax, and evaluating the limits of the individual parts. It uses the known limit: lim(u->0) sin(u)/u = 1."

It explains that for large x, only the terms with the highest power in the numerator and denominator are significant. The limit of the rational part is found by comparing the leading terms (8x^2 / 2x^2), which simplifies to 4. This is then added to the constant 5, resulting in a horizontal asymptote at y = 9."

Then, it multiplies the entire inequality by x to get -x <= x*sin(1/x) <= x. Since the limits of both -x and x as x approaches 0 are 0, the limit of the function squeezed between them must also be 0."

It checks the conditions for IVT: continuity of the polynomial function and showing that f(c)=0 lies between f(0)=-5 and f(2)=7. It then solves f(x)=0 to find x=1 and x=-5, and correctly identifies c=1 as the value guaranteed by the theorem within the given interval."

The solution involves setting the two pieces of the function equal to each other and substituting x=2, then solving the resulting linear equation for 'c'."

The explanations are generally clear and methodologically sound. There are a few minor, self-corrected or inconsequential notational errors that do not detract from the overall instructional quality."

With 10 distinct 'Worked Example' items, the depth is appropriate for the title, and all core concepts and various representations are addressed. Therefore, no completeness deductions were applied.\n\nFor accuracy, one minor notational error was identified at 03:26 where `(x-4)(4-x)` was written instead of `(x-4)(4x)`. This constitutes a 'Minor Slip/Notation Inconsistency' (confidence 0.7 >= 0.6), leading to a -0.2 deduction. Other potential issues were below the confidence threshold for deduction or described self-corrections that mitigated any potential impact.\n\nFor logic, no issues met the confidence threshold for deduction. The self-correction at 00:56, while noted, did not warrant a deduction as it resolved the initial error.\n\nFinal Scores: Accuracy 4.8, Logic 5.0."
