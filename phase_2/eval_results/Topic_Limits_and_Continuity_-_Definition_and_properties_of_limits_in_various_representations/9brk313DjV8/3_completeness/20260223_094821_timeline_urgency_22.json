It includes numerous worked examples and explanations for various limit evaluation techniques (direct substitution, factoring, conjugates, one-sided limits, special trigonometric limits, limits at infinity, Squeeze Theorem) and continuity concepts (IVT, piecewise continuity). The depth (mostly 'Worked Example' or 'Explained') is appropriate for the title, and no core concepts appear to be missing. Therefore, no completeness deductions were applied.\n\nFor error deductions, one minor accuracy issue was identified: a brief, self-corrected arithmetic error (24/6 instead of 24/4). This falls under 'Minor Slip/Notation Inconsistency' and resulted in a -0.2 deduction from the accuracy score. No logic errors were identified. The final scores are 4.8 for accuracy and 5.0 for logic."
