The content_map, with 10 'Worked Example' items covering a wide array of limit evaluation techniques (direct substitution, factoring, conjugates, special trig limits, limits at infinity, one-sided limits, Squeeze Theorem) and related continuity concepts (IVT, piecewise continuity), demonstrates excellent completeness and depth. No completeness deductions were applied as the content is substantial and appropriate for the title's scope, focusing on the application and properties of limits. The 'various representations' are primarily algebraic, which is a common and valid approach for this topic.\n\nFor accuracy, three minor slips were identified where the narrator visually wrote an incorrect term or number but immediately self-corrected verbally and visually. These are categorized as 'Minor Slip/Notation Inconsistency' and each incurred a -0.2 deduction. Despite these minor errors, the final outcomes of all worked examples were correct, and the immediate corrections prevented any misleading information. No logic errors were reported or identified."
