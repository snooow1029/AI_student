By multiplying the inequality -1 <= sin(1/x) <= 1 by x, it establishes that -x <= x*sin(1/x) <= x.

The topics include direct substitution, factoring, simplifying complex fractions, using conjugates, one-sided limits for absolute values, trigonometric limits, limits at infinity for horizontal asymptotes, and the Squeeze Theorem. It also correctly applies the concept of continuity to a piecewise function and demonstrates the use of the Intermediate Value Theorem. The explanations are generally sound and follow standard pedagogical methods. There are a few minor, quickly self-corrected visual errors in the written calculations, which do not affect the final correct answers but could cause momentary confusion for a student."

The idea of a video quiz where I can pause and work through problems is fantastic for my self-paced learning style. The visuals are clear, and the instructor's voice is easy to follow. However, I noticed a critical error at 03:26 where the denominator was factored incorrectly. This is a significant concern for me because I'm relying on this content to teach me the correct methods. A logical flaw in the solution process, especially for a foundational concept like limits, makes me question the reliability of the entire video. It's frustrating to try and follow along, only to realize the core logic is flawed. This kind of error makes it very difficult for me to trust the instruction and truly engage with the material, as I need to be confident that what I'm learning is accurate for my career goals. Minor slips are fine, but a critical error like this really impacts my ability to learn effectively.",
