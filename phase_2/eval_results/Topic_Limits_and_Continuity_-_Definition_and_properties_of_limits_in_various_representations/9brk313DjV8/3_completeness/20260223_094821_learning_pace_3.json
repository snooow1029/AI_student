It first shows that direct substitution results in 0 in the denominator, indicating an indeterminate form. The problem is then solved by factoring the numerator and denominator, canceling the common term (x-3), and then using direct substitution on the simplified expression (x+5)/(x+3) to get 8/6, which simplifies to 4/3."

The method shown is to simplify the complex fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the least common denominator of the inner fractions (4x). This simplifies the expression to (4-x)/[4x(x-4)], which further simplifies to -1/(4x) after factoring and cancellation. Direct substitution then yields -1/16."

It explains that for limits with radicals that result in 0/0, one should multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression containing the radical, which is (sqrt(x) + 4). After simplification and cancellation of the (x-16) term, direct substitution is used on 1/(sqrt(x)+4) to get the answer 1/8."

The left-hand limit (approaching from 6.9) is shown to be -1, and the right-hand limit (approaching from 7.1) is shown to be 1. Because the one-sided limits are not equal, the overall limit is stated to not exist."

It then demonstrates the formal solution by rewriting tan(3x) as sin(3x)/cos(3x), rearranging terms, and applying the special limit identity lim (u->0) of sin(u)/u = 1.

It explains that for rational functions, only the terms with the highest degree in the numerator and denominator are significant. The limit of the rational part is found to be 8/2 = 4. This is added to the constant term +5, yielding a horizontal asymptote at y = 9."

It establishes the inequality -1 <= sin(1/x) <= 1, then multiplies all parts by x to get -x <= x*sin(1/x) <= x. Since the limits of both -x and x as x approaches 0 are 0, the limit of the function squeezed between them must also be 0."

It checks the conditions: continuity of the polynomial, and that f(0) = -5 and f(2) = 7 bracket the target value of 0. It then solves f(c) = 0 by factoring to find c = -5 and c = 1, and concludes that c=1 is the value guaranteed by the theorem within the specified interval."

It covers a broad range of limit evaluation techniques (direct substitution, factoring, conjugates, one-sided, infinity, squeeze theorem) and key continuity concepts (IVT, piecewise continuity) with appropriate depth (mostly 'Worked Example'). Therefore, no completeness deductions were applied.\n\nFor accuracy, a critical error was identified where an incorrect denominator was initially written (24/6 instead of 24/4) at 00:52, leading to a -0.5 deduction. A minor slip occurred at 03:26 with a transcription error in a denominator, resulting in a -0.2 deduction. Both errors were self-corrected by the instructor, but the initial errors were present.\n\nFor logic, a minor issue was noted at 08:32 regarding confusing and jumbled notation when separating a trigonometric limit, which could lead to student confusion about applying limit properties. This was categorized as 'Information Overload' due to unclear presentation, resulting in a -0.2 deduction.\n\nOverall, the content is strong, with minor deductions for specific errors and notational sloppiness."
