However, a deduction of 1.0 point from both Accuracy and Logic scores was applied for 'Missing Core Concepts' because the formal epsilon-delta definition of a limit, a fundamental 'definition' promised by the title, is not covered. Additionally, two minor visual slips (calculation and notation errors) were identified in the 'potential_issues' and each resulted in a -0.2 deduction from the Accuracy score. These minor errors were immediately self-corrected by the narrator and did not propagate to incorrect final answers. No logic errors were identified in the 'potential_issues'."

It starts with simpler direct substitution and moves to more intricate methods like factoring, rationalization, and the Squeeze Theorem. The step-by-step breakdown of each solution is very manageable, and even when minor visual errors occurred, the narrator's immediate correction ensured I didn't get lost. The progression feels natural and builds confidence."

Instead of abstract definitions, I get to see how limits are applied in various scenarios, from simple algebraic functions to complex fractions and trigonometric expressions. The visual presentation, with its clear handwriting, highlighting, and arrows, makes it easy to follow along. Each problem feels like a practical application, directly addressing my goal of understanding how to recognize and apply limit properties. The variety of examples keeps me interested and reinforces the concepts effectively."

  "student_feedback": "I absolutely loved this video! As someone who learns best through examples, this was perfect. Each problem was a clear, step-by-step demonstration of a different limit concept or technique. I especially appreciated how the video showed *why* certain methods were needed, like when direct substitution failed and we had to factor or rationalize. The visual aids were fantastic, making it easy to track the calculations and understand the logic. The Squeeze Theorem example, which I thought would be tricky, was explained so well with the graphs. This video has given me a much stronger grasp of limits and I feel much more prepared for my upcoming calculus topics!",
