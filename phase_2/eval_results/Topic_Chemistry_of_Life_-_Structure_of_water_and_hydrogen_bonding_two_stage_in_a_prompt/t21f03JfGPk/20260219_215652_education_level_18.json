    "accuracy": {
      "score": 5,
      "reasoning": "The scientific information presented is flawless for an introductory level. The explanations of polar covalent bonds, the resulting polarity of water, the nature of hydrogen bonds as intermolecular forces, and their connection to water's emergent properties (high specific heat, cohesion, etc.) are all correct."
    },
    "logic": {
      "score": 5,
      "reasoning": "The lesson follows a perfect logical progression. It starts with the fundamental structure of the water molecule (intramolecular bonds), explains how this structure leads to polarity, connects polarity to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and then uses hydrogen bonding as the unifying principle to explain all of water's unique properties. The scaffolding is clear and effective."
    },
    "adaptability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "As a pharmaceutical professional with a strong science background, the content is far too elementary. The video avoids key terminology like 'electronegativity' and relies on simplistic analogies (e.g., the magnet), which feels like an oversimplification. The pacing is slow, and the entire video serves as a basic review rather than providing the deeper biochemical context I was hoping for. It is not well-adapted for a learner who has already mastered introductory chemistry."

    "engagement": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The engagement level is low for this persona. The teaching style and simple graphics are clearly aimed at high school students. I was hoping for connections to my field, such as water's role as a solvent in drug formulation or its interaction with protein structures, but the examples were limited to general biology (sweating, plants, water striders). The lack of depth and relevant application made it difficult to stay cognitively invested."
