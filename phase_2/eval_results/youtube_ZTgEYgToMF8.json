      "ACTION": "Clarify Conceptual Understanding",
      "timestamp": "01:14",
      "fix": "Elaborate on the concept of 'accumulation of change' with more real-world examples beyond the water tank scenario. Discuss scenarios where the rate of change is not constant, and how integration helps to find the total accumulated change in such cases.",
      "goal": "Deepen the student's understanding of the concept of 'accumulation of change' and its applications."

      "ACTION": "Improve Visual Clarity",
      "timestamp": "01:37",
      "fix": "Use more precise graphical representations. For example, when discussing the area under the curve, use a graphing tool to shade the area dynamically, rather than hand-drawn lines. This will provide a clearer and more accurate visual representation.",
      "goal": "Enhance the student's understanding of the relationship between the area under a curve and the integral."

    "description_en": "The student is a principled thinker with a strong preference for understanding the underlying theories and concepts before diving into practical applications. With a background in high school mathematics and introductory programming, they have a solid grasp of algorithms, basic data structures like arrays and linked lists, and programming languages such as Python and Java. Eager to deepen their understanding, the student is keen to explore advanced data structures and resource management techniques to optimize computational efficiency. They hope to leverage the course to build a robust foundation in computer science principles, enabling them to tackle complex problem-solving scenarios and contribute to software development projects with a strong theoretical underpinning. By the end of the course, the student aims to excel in designing efficient algorithms and managing computational resources effectively, preparing them for future challenges in the tech industry."
