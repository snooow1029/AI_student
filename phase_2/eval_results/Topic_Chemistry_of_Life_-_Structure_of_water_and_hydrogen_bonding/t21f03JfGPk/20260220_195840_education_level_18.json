    "accuracy": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The video correctly explains the core concepts of water's polarity, hydrogen bonding, and the resulting emergent properties. However, it contains a significant visual error in a diagram depicting a hydrogen bond, showing an oxygen-oxygen interaction instead of an oxygen-hydrogen interaction. There are also minor factual inaccuracies regarding the AP curriculum year and the precise percentage of water in the human body.",
      "errors": [
        "0:09 - States the video is for the 'updated 2025-2026 AP Biology curriculum', which is not an official or released curriculum.",
        "0:50 - States the human body is 'about 70% of our body mass', which is an overestimation; the figure is closer to 60-65%.",
        "9:16 - The diagram illustrating cohesion incorrectly depicts the hydrogen bond as an interaction between the oxygen atoms of two water molecules."
      ]
    },
    "logic": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The video follows a logical and effective pedagogical structure: establishing the molecular structure and polarity of water, explaining how this leads to hydrogen bonding, and then demonstrating how hydrogen bonds cause water's unique emergent properties. The use of analogies (magnets) and simple anchor terms ('sticky') is effective. The score is not a 5 because the introduction is slightly unfocused, and a key diagram at 9:16 visually contradicts the correct explanation of hydrogen bonding, which could confuse learners.",
      "issues": [
        "0:05 - The introduction previews the entire 'Chemistry of Life' unit before narrowing the focus to water, which slightly dilutes the initial focus of the video.",
        "9:16 - A diagram incorrectly shows how water molecules cohere, creating a potential conflict between the visual and audio explanation of hydrogen bonding."
