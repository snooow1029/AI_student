      "score": 3.0,
      "reasoning": "The video contains several minor factual inaccuracies (AP curriculum year, percentage of water in the human body). More significantly, a key diagram illustrating cohesion is fundamentally incorrect, showing an attraction between two oxygen atoms rather than between the hydrogen of one molecule and the oxygen of another. While the speaker verbally describes the interaction correctly, the persistent and incorrect visual is highly misleading and constitutes a major error.",
      "errors": [
        "0:10 - States the video is for the 'updated 2025-2026 AP Biology curriculum', which is an incorrect year.",
        "0:50 - States the human body is 'about 70% of our body mass', which is an oversimplification and on the high end of the accepted range (typically 55-65% for adults).",
        "9:16 - The diagram for 'Cohesion' incorrectly depicts the bond forming between the oxygen atoms of two adjacent water molecules, rather than between a hydrogen and an oxygen."

    "logic": {
      "score": 3.0,
      "reasoning": "The overall logical structure is sound, progressing from the structure of water to its polarity, then to hydrogen bonding, and finally to its emergent properties. This is a standard and effective pedagogical sequence. However, the score is reduced due to a rambling introduction that delays the core content and a significant logical disconnect created by the inaccurate cohesion diagram at 9:16, which visually contradicts the verbal explanation.",
      "issues": [
        "0:05-0:45 - The introduction is unfocused, discussing the creator's video series and listing topics that will be covered later, which detracts from the immediate topic.",
        "9:16 - The flawed visual representation of cohesion creates a logical conflict for the learner, who is simultaneously told that opposite charges attract while being shown two partially negative atoms bonding."
