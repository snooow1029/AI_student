    "accuracy": {
      "score": 2.0,
      "reasoning": "The video contains a major conceptual and visual error in its depiction of hydrogen bonding, which is the central topic. The diagram at 9:16 incorrectly shows cohesion as an attraction between the oxygen atoms of two water molecules, which is fundamentally wrong. Hydrogen bonds form between a partially positive hydrogen atom of one molecule and a partially negative oxygen atom of another. While the speaker's narration is mostly correct, this visual misrepresentation is severe enough to instill a significant misconception. A minor administrative error regarding the AP curriculum year also contributes to the score reduction.",
      "errors": [
        "0:10 - States the video is for the 'updated 2025-2026 AP Biology curriculum', which is an incorrect year for the curriculum update.",
        "9:16 - The diagram illustrating cohesion incorrectly depicts the bond forming between the oxygen atoms of two adjacent water molecules, rather than between an oxygen and a hydrogen atom."

    },
    "logic": {
      "score": 3.0,
      "reasoning": "The video follows a sound and logical progression, moving from the structure of a single water molecule (polar covalent bonds) to the interactions between molecules (hydrogen bonds), and then to the emergent properties (cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, etc.). The use of the magnet analogy is effective. However, the score is capped at 'functional/okay' due to a critical logical failure: using a factually incorrect diagram (at 9:16) to explain the core concept of cohesion. This creates a direct conflict between the visual information and the (mostly correct) audio narration, undermining the instructional scaffolding and potentially confusing the learner.",
      "issues": [
        "0:26 - The introduction is somewhat unfocused, listing all the macromolecules of the unit before stating that the video is about water. This could be streamlined for better clarity.",
        "9:16 - There is a major logical disconnect where the speaker explains cohesion while a diagram incorrectly illustrates it. The visual aid contradicts the concept being taught, forcing the student to ignore what they are seeing to understand the narration."

  "subjective_evaluation": {
    "adaptability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The content level was mostly a review for me, given my background in basic chemistry and environmental science. The concepts of polarity and hydrogen bonding were familiar, so it wasn't too difficult. However, it felt a bit too introductory and didn't challenge me to think about these properties in a more complex, applied way. The magnet analogy, for instance, is very basic. I was hoping for a deeper dive that would bridge the gap between these fundamental principles and their role in complex systems."

    "engagement": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "As someone motivated by projects, I found the video lacking in real-world applications relevant to my interests in environmental science. While the celery experiment was a decent example of capillary action, I was hoping for connections to things like water purification or soil science. The major issue was the diagram for cohesion, which directly contradicted the verbal explanation. This was incredibly distracting and frustrating, as it undermined the video's credibility and made it difficult to trust the information for practical use in my projects."

  "student_feedback": "This video covers the exact topic I need for my environmental projects, which is great. It served as a decent refresher on the properties of water. However, I was hoping for more examples that apply these concepts to real-world challenges, like how cohesion and adhesion play a role in water filtration systems. The presentation felt a bit generic, and I got really confused when the diagram for cohesion showed the opposite of what the instructor was explaining. That error made it hard for me to stay engaged and trust the content.",
