  "scoring_rationale": "Accuracy Score:\n- Starting score: 5.0\n- Issue at 01:41 (typo 'POLAI'): Confidence (0.2) is below the threshold for any accuracy deduction rule. No deduction.\n- Issue at 09:16 (incorrect cohesion diagram): This is a 'Critical Fact/Formula Error' (confidence 1.0 >= 0.8) as it fundamentally misrepresents hydrogen bonding. Deduction: -0.5 points.\n- Final Accuracy Score: 5.0 - 0.5 = 4.5.\n\nLogic Score:\n- Starting score: 5.0\n- Issue at 02:00 (bar magnet analogy): Confidence (0.6) is below the threshold for 'Logic Leap', 'Prerequisite Violation', and 'Causal Inconsistency'. It does not semantically fit 'Information Overload'. No deduction.\n- Issue at 09:27 (verbal correction vs. incorrect diagram): This is a 'Causal Inconsistency' (confidence 0.9 >= 0.7) because the instructor's correct verbal explanation contradicts the persistent incorrect visual representation of cohesion, creating a logical conflict for the learner. Deduction: -0.2 points.\n- Final Logic Score: 5.0 - 0.2 = 4.8.\n\nAll deductions are based strictly on the provided rules and confidence thresholds. Issues not meeting confidence thresholds or not fitting rule definitions were not penalized."
