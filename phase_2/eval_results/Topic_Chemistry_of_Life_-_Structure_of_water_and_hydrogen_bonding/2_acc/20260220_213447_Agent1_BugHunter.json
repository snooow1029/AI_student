The last major AP Biology curriculum update was for the 2019-2020 school year, and no official update for 2025-2026 has been announced by the College Board.

Since the oxygen atom in a water molecule is the center of the partial negative charge, two oxygen atoms would repel each other, not form an attractive hydrogen bond. The narrator does point out this error in the diagram, but the visual itself is scientifically inaccurate.",

  "observation_summary": "The video provides a generally accurate and logical explanation of water's polarity and the resulting properties. The primary issues identified include a potentially misleading statement about the AP curriculum timeline, a scientifically inaccurate diagram (which the narrator commendably self-corrects), a minor spelling error in an annotation, and a point of potential terminological confusion regarding the definition of a 'bond'."
