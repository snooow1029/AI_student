  "scoring_rationale": "The accuracy score received significant deductions due to multiple verified issues. A critical deduction of 2.5 points was applied for the demonstrably false claim about the 2025-2026 AP Biology curriculum update (00:09). Another critical deduction of 2.5 points was made for a scientifically inaccurate diagram depicting hydrogen bonding between two oxygen atoms (09:16). Two minor deductions of 0.5 points each were applied for inconsistent terminology regarding hydrogen bonds (03:50), and a spelling error ('xyler' instead of 'xylem') (09:53). The total accuracy deductions amounted to 6.0 points, resulting in a final accuracy score of 1.0 (minimum allowed). No issues met the criteria for logic deductions based on the provided rules and confidence thresholds."
